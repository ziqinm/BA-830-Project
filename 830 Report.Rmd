This is the BA 830 experiment report of Cohort A Team 8. 

[intro]

### a. Your causal question of interest.

We are interested in the potential causal effects of listening to music on instant memory. 

[to be edited]


### b. Your experimental design and what data you collected.

Our null hypothesis is that listening to music has no effect on people's instant memory. The alternative hypothesis states that there exists effect of.

[design]

[data collected]

### c. Why you chose the experiment design.

[why choose this song]

[why number sequence]: easy to impliment for everyone. No additional skills required. No bias

[Give out QR code randomly]: group members did not know which assignment was given out, hence eliminating xxx bias

### d. Summary statistics about the data.

1. Load the data

```{r}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lfe)

tr = read_excel("Treatment.xlsx")
colnames(tr)
tr_c = tr %>% select(`Accuracy in %`, Q13, Q14, Q15)
tr_c = tr_c[-1, ]
names(tr_c)[1] = "Accuracy"
tr_c$Treatment = 1
# write.csv(tr_c, "Treatment_c.csv")
# t = fread("Treatment_c.csv")

ctrl = read_excel("Control.xlsx")
colnames(ctrl)
ctrl_c = ctrl %>% select(`%`, Q13, Q14, Q15)
ctrl_c = ctrl_c[-1, ]
names(ctrl_c)[1] = "Accuracy"
ctrl_c$Treatment = 0
# write.csv(ctrl_c, "Control_c.csv")
# c = fread("Control_c.csv")

data = rbind(tr_c, ctrl_c)
write.csv(data, "data.csv")
table = fread("data.csv")
```

2. Summary statistics

```{r}
t = tableF[Treatment == 1]
ggplot(t) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Q14, y = Accuracy)) + 
  labs(x = "Habits")
```

```{r}
c = tableF[Treatment == 0]
ggplot(c) + 
  geom_boxplot(aes(x = Q14, y = Accuracy)) + 
  labs(x = "Habits")
```

```{r}
ggplot(t) +
  geom_histogram(aes(Accuracy))
```

```{r}
ggplot(c) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(Accuracy))
```


### e. Treatment effects


```{r}
trF = read_excel("Treatment-FULL.xlsx")
colnames(trF)
trF_c = trF %>% select(`Accuracy in %`, Q13, Q14, Q15)
trF_c = trF_c[-1, ]
names(trF_c)[1] = "Accuracy"
trF_c$Treatment = 1


ctrlF = read_excel("Control-FULL.xlsx")
colnames(ctrlF)
ctrlF_c = ctrlF %>% select(`%`, Q13, Q14, Q15)
ctrlF_c = ctrlF_c[-1, ]
names(ctrlF_c)[1] = "Accuracy"
ctrlF_c$Treatment = 0

dataF = rbind(trF_c, ctrlF_c)
write.csv(dataF, "dataF.csv")
tableF = fread("dataF.csv")
open = c()
for (i in nrow(tableF)) {
 open = ifelse(is.na(tableF$Q13), 0, 1)
}
open
tableF$open = open
```


```{r}
summary(felm(Accuracy ~ Treatment, data = tableF))
```

```{r}
summary(felm(Accuracy ~ Treatment | Q14, data = tableF))
```
Found that whether participants listen to music when studying is not a fixed effect in this experiment.


```{r}
summary(felm(Accuracy ~ 1 | 0 | (open ~ Treatment), data = tableF))
```
Conclusion: Listening to music can increase instant memory. 


### f. Limitations of your study.

[We had no control over the experiment process]

Example: 

- possible cheating in exriment

- spillover

- participants intentionally skipped the instructions; did not take is seriously

- memorizing time may be different

[earbuds, location, volume]

[sample size too small]

[Survey Design]: no sound in control's link, so participants in control group might be distracted or confused by the silence, thus reducing their time available to memorize.
